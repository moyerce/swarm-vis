\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}

% Write an eight page technical paper describing your project in the style of an IEEE Visualization Technical Paper (other formats may be acceptable with pre-approval).

% Sections you should plan to include are: abstract, introduction, related work (adapt your literature review for this), implementation, results, future directions, and references.

% Your paper should include figures and images as appropriate.

% A complete draft of your paper, including figures and images, must be submitted in advance of the final paper deadline.

% Your draft should be a complete paper that is as strong and polished as you can make it.

% Aim for something that you believe is ready for submission to a conference or journal.

% The course instructor will serve as reviewer for these papers and make suggestions as to how they might be improved.

% You may submit earlier, not necessarily complete, drafts of your paper if you would like feedback earlier in the writing process.

% Correct spelling and grammar count in all submitted work, so check them before you hand anything in.
